# group_5_project_1

In order to run our code, you will need to have an API key for Geoapify. You can get a free API key at: https://myprojects.geoapify.com/projects. Once you have your API key, you will need to have it stored in a .gitignore file created in the same folder as the Jupyter Notebook for this project. You can name the file “api_keys.py” or something similar and within that file you will need to have the following saved:

    # Geoapify API Key

    geoapify_key = "YOUR API KEY HERE"

You will also need the following CSV files which we used for our data analysis:

    DataForTable2.1WHR2023, fsi-2022-download.csv, DataForFigure2.1WHR2023

    These files are in the "CSV_Files" folder

Our Python code/Jupyter Notebooks are in the "Python_JupyterNotebooks" folder and our image files are in the "Image_Files" folder

We referenced course files, our instructor and TAs, Slack, a BSC tutor, ChatGPT, Geoapify.com, pitch.com and Slack Overflow to complete this project
